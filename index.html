  <p>My name is Pavan Amin and I am currently a senior at Rutgers University studying Finance and BAIT, expected to be graduating in May 2022. I am originally from Jersey City, New Jersey, where I attended a STEM high school and so initially never had much exposure to finance. However, during my junior year in high school, I had the opportunity to intern at Brown Brothers Harriman and visit the trading floor, which is when I immediately knew that finance was for me. As a result, when I got to Rutgers, I tried taking advantage of all the opportunities given to me, whether that was joining the Little Investment Bankers of Rutgers, the Rutgers Student Managed Fund, or the Road to Wall Street Program. Through these activities, I was able to land an internship my freshman year within investment banking at a small one-person shop from where I then interned at Merrill in their Global Wealth Management Division during my sophomore year. Moving on, this past summer, I interned at Bank of America within their Global Markets Sales & Trading Program, where I rotated within Securitized Products Trading and Cross Asset Solutions. I, fortunately, received a full-time offer and will be returning to the firm in July 2022. Outside of school and work, I love to play and watch sports (basketball, baseball, and football), love to travel, and love to cook.</p>
